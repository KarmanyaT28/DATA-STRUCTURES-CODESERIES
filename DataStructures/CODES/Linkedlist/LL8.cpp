//Wanna learn how to reverse your linked list??
//See the code below
//VVVVVVVVVVVV
//I am sure you will pretty much enjoy this code series as we will be 
//learning to play with data structures more later on.

//We WILL learn how to reverse a linked list in 
//three ways including the recursion method.

//As we have seen in above codes:
//the display function was:

//CODE

//void linkedlist::display(){
//	Node *p;
//	while(p){
//		cout<<p->data;
//		p=p->next;
//	}
//}

//Now If we simply want to print out linked list in reverse order!!
//then the code will be as simple as:
//CODE

//void linkedlist::display(){
//	Node *p;
//	while(p){
//		p=p->next;//This line is brought up here.
//		cout<<p->data;
//	}
//}
